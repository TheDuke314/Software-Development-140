# Rock Paper Scissors
This program was made for my Software-Development-140 class

Rock Paper Scissors is a program in which you get to play rock paper scissors against a computer. 
It allows you to choose what choice you pick and then will tell you the choice of the computer. 
It will then pop up a box with information on whether you won, lost or drew the game. 
It also informs you of number of games played, the number of games won, the number of games lost, and the number of games drawn.
If you want to start over the reset button will allow you to reset the number of games, games won, games lost, and games drawn.
